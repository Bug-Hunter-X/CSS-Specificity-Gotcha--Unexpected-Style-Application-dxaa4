The solution involves understanding and utilizing the CSS specificity rules to predict and control how different styles are applied.  Here's a revised CSS file which clarifies the intended styling. The most specific selector will always be applied.

```css
/*Improved CSS with comments to clarify the rules and their specificity*/
.container {
  background-color: lightblue; /* Low specificity */
}

#my-element {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* Medium specificity */
}

.container #my-element {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* Higher specificity */
}

.container #my-element.special {
  background-color: yellow; /* Highest specificity */
}
```
By ensuring that the selectors are written in a way that reflects the desired order of precedence, one can avoid the unexpected behavior demonstrated in the original CSS code.
