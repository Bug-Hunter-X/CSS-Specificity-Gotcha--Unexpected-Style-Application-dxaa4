# CSS Specificity Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS selector specificity and the cascading order of styles. The bug showcases how multiple CSS rules targeting the same element can lead to unexpected styling behavior if specificity and cascading are not thoroughly understood.

## Bug Description
The `bug.css` file contains CSS code where multiple styles target the same element (`#my-element`).  Due to the differing specificity of the selectors, the final rendered style might not be what's intuitively expected. The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution which improves the code and demonstrates the correct approach to deal with this behavior.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or create a basic HTML file linking to `bug.css`) in your web browser.
3. Observe the background color of the element with the ID `my-element`.  The color will likely not match the developer's intentions based on the order of the CSS rules.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file addresses the issue by carefully considering selector specificity and potentially refactoring the CSS to enhance maintainability and reduce ambiguity.  Understanding CSS specificity is vital for resolving similar situations and ensuring consistent and expected styles.
